## Why EquiCite?
Research by HBCU scholars is under‑indexed and harder to find in mainstream discovery tools. EquiCite makes that work more visible by:
- indexing open bibliographic data (e.g., OpenAlex) with an HBCU lens,
- providing simple, fast search & filters,
- generating copy‑ready citations.


> Data is open; the *curation* and *UX* are the product.

## Features (MVP)
- 🔎 Faceted search (author, institution, year, type)
- 📥 Copy citation to clipboard (APA/MLA placeholder)
- 🔗 Direct links to works in source registries
- 🏷️ Institution tagging (seed list of HBCUs)


Planned next: relevance tuning, author disambiguation, affiliation cleanup, bulk export, institution logos.
